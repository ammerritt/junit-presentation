Schema Gotchas

  If you have been using Oracle and are going to be using HSQL for your JUnit test cases there are a couple of gotchas to consider.
  It's possible to write sql statements without specifying the schema name and relying on oracle to map the default schema based on 
  the connecting user for the connection.  This keeps the query a little more abstract and portable.  However default user schemas 
  are not supported in HSQL (yet... its in their dev branch)  
  
  Consider stripping your DBUnit xml files and liquibase changelog of any reference to a schema.  When your database is created and data inserted it will default
  to the public schema.  This would be a good workaround if you coded your sql queries without declaring schema names.  If you do have schema names in your queries
  then there is no need to worry and you will need to make sure that your dbunit and liquibase changelog contain schema names.
