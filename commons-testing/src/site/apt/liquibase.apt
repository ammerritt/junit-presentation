Liquibase Appendix

  Liquibase has some utilities that you can run from the command line to generate a a database schema.  Download the
  Liquibase core package file from {{http://www.liquibase.org/download}} and extract the files to the folder of your choosing.  We are going to
  create a changelog file that will be used for creating your database for unit tests.

   liquibase --driver=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver \
      --classpath=\path\to\classes:jdbcdriver.jar \
      --changeLogFile=com/example/db.changelog.xml \
      --url="jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE" \
      --username=scott \
      --password=tiger \
      generateChangeLog

  Once you have created your changelog you may need to massage the schema a little bit.  If you are extracting an Oracle database and planning
  on importing the schema into HSQLDB you will need to replace all the VARCHAR2(?,?) with a simple VARCHAR and you will need to replace all the NUMBER(?,?)
  to NUMERIC, BIGINT etc and replace FLOAT(?) with FLOAT.  This should be pretty straightforward in remapping the correct types.
